    "### Mesh Analysis\n",
    "Mesh is a loop that doesn't consists of any other loop inside it. Mesh analysis technique, uses mesh currents as variables, instead of currents in the elements to analyze the circuit. Therefore, this method absolutely reduces the number of equations to be solved. Mesh analysis applies the Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to determine the unknown currents in a given circuit. Mesh analysis is also called as mesh-current method or loop analysis. After finding the mesh currents using KVL, voltages anywhere in a given circuit can be determined by using Ohms law. [1]"

    "### Cramer's Rule\n",
    "Cramer's rule provides a fundamental way to solve the system of linear equations generated by nodal and mesh analysis by expressing the solution variables (node voltages or mesh currents) in terms of determinants of matrices derived from the system. The fundamental principle is to represent the system of equations as AX = B, calculate the determinant of the coefficient matrix (D) and modified matrices (Dx, Dy, etc.), and then find the solution using x = Dx/D, y = Dy/D, and so on, provided D is not zero. And here are the formulas for nodal and mesh analysis using the Cramer's rule method: [2]"
